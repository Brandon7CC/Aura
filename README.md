# [DRAFT] Aura iOS Agent


## Description
Aura is an iOS payload designed to interact with a Mythic C2 (command and control) server and was developed over the [2024 Microsoft Global Hackathon](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/MicrosoftGlobalHackathon2024). To fit within the time constraint of one week:
* The agent communicates over plain text HTTP channels
* Mythic will manage and initate the agent builds per-usual, but the actual compilation and configuration of the agent will take place remotely on macOS w/iOS SDK outside of Docker.
* A limited number of commands will be implemented.

### Requirements
* iOS 12


## Warnings
* The Aura agent currently only supports plain-text HTTP comms.
* This is a development build only requiring a macOS build server for iOS compilation.
    * Mythic usually requires Agent code be hosted in Docker containers.


## Usage
1. Edit the Mythic environement file: `Mythic/.env` to:
    1. `MYTHIC_SERVER_BIND_LOCALHOST_ONLY="false"`
    2. `RABBITMQ_BIND_LOCALHOST_ONLY="false‚Äù`
    3. Grab the password for RabbitMQ
2. Start [Mythic C2](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) (you'll need to have this already)
3. Clone this repository
4. Edit `Payload_Type/rabbitmq_config.json` with the values from the Mythic server
5. Run `python Payload_Type/main.py` 
6. ü•≥ In the Mythic UI you can now build and install Aura!!
